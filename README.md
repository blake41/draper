# Repository Moved

Draper started out as a small hack and has grown into a great project, thanks to the work of key 
contributors and the community at large. As such, it no longer makes sense to hog the spotlight here,
but instead let it continue to grow as its own organization.

Please find the new repository at https://github.com/drapergem/draper

Thanks for your support!

### Updating Gemfile Dependency

If you're building Draper from source in a `Gemfile`, update your dependency to:

```
gem 'draper', :git => git://github.com/drapergem/draper.git
```
